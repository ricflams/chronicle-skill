# Session: v2.0 Reboot

Full day session

## What Happened

Complete reassessment and reboot of Chronicle after critical analysis revealed ~60% overlap with Claude's native Memory and Tasks features.

**Killed:**
- Task management (Claude Tasks handles this)
- AI context preservation claims (Claude Memory handles this)
- Elaborate 15-28 minute initialization interview
- Y-statement format for principles
- Monolithic session-log.md and lessons.md files

**Kept & Enhanced:**
- ADRs (Michael Nygard's 3-section pattern)
- Lessons learned with tags/severity
- Session narratives for project timeline
- truth.md and principles.md as always-load core

**New:**
- Individual timestamped files (YYYYMMDD-HHMM-slug.md)
- Calendar-based automatic archival
- Progressive disclosure initialization (~5 min, not 30)
- Natural language principles with explicit tradeoffs
- Token budget: ~2.5K always-load, ~7K total

## Decisions Made

3 major decisions:
- Complement don't compete (focus on team-visible git-tracked artifacts)
- Individual timestamped files (conflict-free team collaboration)
- Progressive disclosure (low barrier to entry)

## Key Insight

What was unique yesterday may be redundant today. The remaining 40% — team-visible ADRs, structured lessons, git-tracked session history — is the actual differentiator. Honest positioning beats feature creep.
