# Session: Organizational Cleanup

~1.5 hours

## What Happened

Made Chronicle practice its own principles (dogfooding). Fixed structural violations discovered during validation:

- Created 7 missing ADR files using content from project-truth.md
- Created .chronicle/context/visuals/ directory with README placeholder
- Renamed component-manifest.md → parts-manifest.md per documentation
- Moved tasks/ → .chronicle/tasks/
- Established dogfooding principle as ADR-011

## Key Insight

If we can't follow our own structure, it needs redesign. The repository itself should appear as if Chronicle initialized it.
