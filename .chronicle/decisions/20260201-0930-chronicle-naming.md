# Chronicle Naming

## Context

Initial working name was "regenerative-memory" — technically accurate but cold and abstract. Need a name that evokes recording a journey, feels warm, is memorable.

## Decision

Rename project from "regenerative-memory" to "chronicle".

## Consequences

**Positive:** Descriptive — everyone knows what a chronicle is. Warm storytelling connotations. Short, memorable, brandable.

**Negative:** Less technical-sounding. Chronicle is a common word (SEO challenge).
