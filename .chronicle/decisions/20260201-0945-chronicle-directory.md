# .chronicle/ Directory Name

## Context

What should the main directory be called? Options included .ai/, .context/, .memory/, .chronicle/.

## Decision

Use `.chronicle/` as the directory name — branded, semantic, memorable.

## Consequences

**Positive:** Immediately clear what the folder contains. Unique namespace. Works for any project type.

**Negative:** Longer than alternatives like `.ai/`. Requires explaining the "Chronicle" concept.
