# Bootstrap and Exit

## Context

Chronicle aims to create self-contained, long-lasting project documentation. Should the skill remain active throughout the project lifecycle, or should it transfer knowledge and exit?

## Decision

The chronicle skill bootstraps the project by creating complete documentation structure and protocols, then exits. The project becomes fully self-contained and skill-independent.

## Consequences

**Positive:** True self-containment — works forever even if skill disappears. All protocols visible and editable in CLAUDE.md. No version conflicts.

**Negative:** No automatic protocol updates — each project frozen at initialization version. Must be comprehensive upfront.
