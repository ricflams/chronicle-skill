# Three-Section ADR Format

## Context

Chronicle v1 used a 9-section ADR template. Research revealed Michael Nygard's original ADR pattern used only 3 sections: Context, Decision, Consequences.

## Decision

Adopt Nygard's minimal 3-section format. Drop Status, Date, Alternatives sections from the template (can add if needed, but not required).

## Consequences

**Positive:** Faster to write. Easier to read. Lower barrier to documenting decisions. Matches established pattern.

**Negative:** Less structured exploration of alternatives. Status tracking now implicit.
