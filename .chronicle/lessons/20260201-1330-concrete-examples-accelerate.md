# Concrete Examples Accelerate Decisions

**Tags:** #communication #documentation  
**Severity:** Low — insight rather than failure

## What Happened

Every time we showed software/DIY/presentation examples for a concept, abstract ideas became immediately clear and decisions accelerated.

## Root Cause

Abstract descriptions leave room for interpretation. Examples constrain to shared understanding.

## What We Learned

When explaining a system or pattern, always include concrete examples for each major concept. Reduces cognitive load, prevents misunderstanding, speeds up decisions.

## Prevention

Make it a habit: for every abstract concept, add "For example: [specific case]."
