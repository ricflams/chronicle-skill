# ADR-004: Name Change to "Chronicle"

**Date:** 2025-02-01
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Project branding and positioning

## Context and Problem

Initial working name was "regenerative-memory" - technically accurate but felt cold and abstract. Need a name that:
- Evokes the concept of recording a journey
- Feels warm and inviting
- Is memorable and brandable
- Conveys continuity and history

## Decision

Rename project from "regenerative-memory" to "chronicle".

## Alternatives Considered

Evaluated ~20 alternatives across several themes:

**Journey/Path theme:**
- memory-trail
- project-path
- context-trail
- journey-log
- **Why considered:** Emphasizes the journey aspect
- **Why rejected:** Too literal, not distinctive

**History/Memory theme:**
- living-history
- project-memoir  
- context-memory
- **chronicle** ✅
- **Why considered:** Emphasizes preservation and narrative
- **Why "chronicle" won:** Perfect balance of warmth and clarity

**Technical theme:**
- regenerative-memory (original)
- context-keeper
- project-state
- **Why rejected:** Too technical, lacks personality

**Metaphor theme:**
- project-dna
- memory-seed
- context-tree
- **Why rejected:** Too abstract, requires explanation

## Why "Chronicle" Works

1. **Evocative** - Immediately suggests "recording events over time"
2. **Warm** - Has literary, storytelling connotations
3. **Clear** - No explanation needed for what it does
4. **Brandable** - Short, memorable, .chronicle/ directory is elegant
5. **Universal** - Works for software, DIY, creative projects equally well
6. **Action-oriented** - "Chronicling" is something you do

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Better marketing - More approachable than "regenerative-memory"
- ✅ Clearer purpose - Name itself explains the concept
- ✅ Memorable - Easier to recommend to others
- ✅ `.chronicle/` directory - Beautiful and semantic

**Negative:**
- ❌ Broader term - Many things could be "chronicles"
- ❌ Less technically precise - Doesn't convey "regenerative" aspect
- ❌ Common word - Less unique than invented term

**Trade-off:** Accepted less precision for better approachability. Technical accuracy matters less than adoption.

## Implementation

- Repository name: chronicle-skill
- Directory name: `.chronicle/`
- User-facing documentation: "Chronicle: Never lose context in long-running projects"
- Tagline emphasizes continuity and journey
