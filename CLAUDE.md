# Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview

This is the chronicle skill - a Claude skill that bootstraps comprehensive project documentation systems for long-running AI-assisted projects. The skill creates self-contained `.chronicle/` directories that enable task organization, journey documentation, and AI context preservation.

## ⚠️ Repository Structure

**chronicle-skill/** = THE SKILL (pristine source for distribution)
- SKILL.md = Skill definition
- USING-CHRONICLE.md = User guide
- Do NOT put .chronicle/ here - keep it clean for packaging

**.chronicle/** = Development chronicle (at repo root)
- Documents THIS project (building the skill)
- Follows the structure defined in chronicle-skill/SKILL.md
- Think: "This is a project using chronicle to build chronicle"

**Sync Rule:** When chronicle-skill/SKILL.md structure changes → update .chronicle/ to match
(Like re-running the skill on this project)

## Chronicle System

This project maintains a chronicle in `.chronicle/` where documentation
is the source of truth.

### Planning Mode → Task List Workflow

**When in Planning Mode:**
Planning mode creates plans but does NOT implement or edit files.

**Workflow:**
1. User and Claude collaborate on task plan in planning mode
2. **User manually switches to agent mode** (Claude cannot do this)
3. User signals task creation with phrases like:
   - "Add the task"
   - "Create the task"
   - "Task accepted"
   - Or any clear indication to proceed

**When user says "add the task" (in agent mode):**
1. Create task file in `.chronicle/tasks/NNNN-task-name.md` based on the plan
2. Confirm task created
3. Ask: "Should I start working on this task now?"
4. Wait for user response:
   - "Yes" / "Start" → Begin implementation
   - "No" / "Just queue it" → Stop, task queued for later

**Starting work later:**
User says "Start working on [task name]" → Begin implementation

### Current Work

Check `.chronicle/tasks/` folder for what to work on next. Use "list tasks" command for overview.

### Key Decisions

See `.chronicle/context/decisions/` for architectural decisions, especially:
- DEC-001: Bootstrap-and-exit pattern
- DEC-002: Protocols in CLAUDE.md (this is why these protocols are here)
- DEC-010: Individual task files (.chronicle/tasks/ folder, not active-tasks.md)

### Recent Progress

See `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md` for detailed development chronicle.

### Before Starting Work

1. Read `.chronicle/project-truth.md` for complete context (25 min)
2. List tasks to see current work: "List tasks" or "Show tasks"
3. Review `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md` for recent developments

### Task Management

**List all tasks:**
When user says "List tasks" / "Show tasks" / "What are the tasks?":
1. Scan `.chronicle/tasks/` directory
2. Read each task file to get title and creator
3. Display numbered list with format: `0001: Task name (created by X on DATE)`

**What should I work on?**
→ List tasks, suggest highest priority or ask user to pick

**Create new task:**
When planning mode produces task or user requests:
1. Find highest number in `.chronicle/tasks/` directory
2. Increment by 1 (e.g., 0011 → 0012)
3. Create `.chronicle/tasks/NNNN-task-name.md` with format:
   ```markdown
   # Task: [Task Name]
   
   **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD by [User Name]
   
   ## Description
   
   [Task details and plan]
   ```
4. Confirm creation

**When task completed:**
1. User says "[task] is complete" or "mark [task] complete"
2. Move task file from `.chronicle/tasks/NNNN-name.md` → `.chronicle/journey/completed-tasks/NNNN-name.md`
3. Update file with completion info (add "**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (Duration: Xh)" after Created line)
4. Add entry to `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md`
5. Suggest next task from remaining tasks

**When problem encountered:**
→ Log in `.chronicle/journey/lessons.md`

**When significant decision made:**
→ Create ADR in `.chronicle/context/decisions/`

### Session End

When user says "update chronicle":
1. Summarize session (key accomplishments, decisions, learnings)
2. Update `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md` with detailed narrative
3. Ensure completed tasks moved to `.chronicle/journey/completed-tasks/` (check if any missed)
4. Create ADRs in `.chronicle/context/decisions/` if significant decisions made
5. Update diagrams in `.chronicle/context/visuals/` if structure changed
6. Document problems/learnings in `.chronicle/journey/lessons.md`
7. Weekly check: If >7 days of logs, suggest compressing into `.chronicle/project-truth.md`
8. **Skill sync check:** If chronicle-skill/ changed, sync to root (.chronicle/ and USING-CHRONICLE.md)

### Context Management

**Always in context:**
- .chronicle/project-truth.md
- .chronicle/tasks/* (all active task files)
- .chronicle/context/*
- .chronicle/journey/session-log.md
- .chronicle/journey/lessons.md
- .chronicle/execution/*

**Never in context:**
- .chronicle/journey/completed-tasks/* (human reference only)

## Project-Specific Context

### Skill Implementation Notes

**Primary file:** chronicle-skill/SKILL.md (skill definition)
**User guide:** chronicle-skill/USING-CHRONICLE.md

**Templates (optional future):**
- Could extract templates from SKILL.md to chronicle-skill/templates/
- Templates would be based on .chronicle/ real usage

---

## Development Workflow

1. Work on chronicle-skill/SKILL.md (the product)
2. If structure changes, sync to .chronicle/ (dogfooding)
3. Use .chronicle/ to document development work

**Key insight:** The skill should be comprehensive enough that after initialization, the project is completely self-contained. We're dogfooding this by using chronicle to document chronicle.

### Development Approach

1. Use chronicle principles to document design decisions
2. Create all templates based on real usage (this repo)
3. Test with multiple project types before release
4. Extract common patterns into skill logic

### Testing Strategy

See `.chronicle/execution/validation-strategy.md` for complete validation approach.

*Note: This project uses chronicle to document itself - it's self-referential by design.*
