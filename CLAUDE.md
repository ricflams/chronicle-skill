# Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview

This is the chronicle skill - a Claude skill that bootstraps comprehensive project documentation systems for long-running AI-assisted projects. The skill creates self-contained `.chronicle/` directories that enable task organization, journey documentation, and AI context preservation.

## Chronicle System

This project maintains a chronicle in `.chronicle/` where documentation
is the source of truth.

### Current Work

Check `.chronicle/active-tasks.md` for what to work on next.

### Key Decisions

See `.chronicle/context/decisions/` for architectural decisions, especially:
- DEC-001: Bootstrap-and-exit pattern
- DEC-002: Protocols in CLAUDE.md (this is why these protocols are here)
- DEC-003: 10-file consolidated structure

### Recent Progress

See `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md` for detailed development chronicle.

### Before Starting Work

1. Read `.chronicle/project-truth.md` for complete context (25 min)
2. Check `.chronicle/active-tasks.md` for current work
3. Review `.chronicle/journey/session-log.md` for recent developments

### Task Management

**What should I work on?**
→ Read `.chronicle/active-tasks.md`

**When task completed:**
1. Check off in active-tasks.md
2. Move to journey/completed-tasks.md (format: [x] Task (Completed: DATE, Duration: Xh))
3. Add entry to journey/session-log.md
4. Suggest next task

**When problem encountered:**
→ Log in `.chronicle/journey/lessons.md`

**When significant decision made:**
→ Create ADR in `.chronicle/context/decisions/`

### Session End

When user says "update chronicle":
1. Summarize session
2. Update session-log.md
3. Move completed tasks
4. Create ADRs if needed
5. Document problems in lessons.md

### Context Management

**Always in context:**
- .chronicle/project-truth.md
- .chronicle/active-tasks.md
- .chronicle/context/*
- .chronicle/journey/session-log.md
- .chronicle/journey/lessons.md
- .chronicle/execution/*

**Never in context:**
- .chronicle/journey/completed-tasks.md (human reference only)

## Project-Specific Context

### Skill Implementation Notes

**Primary file:** SKILL.md (main skill definition)

**Templates needed:**
- claude-protocols.md (the ~200 line protocol that goes in CLAUDE.md)
- project-truth-template.md
- active-tasks-template.md
- session-log-template.md
- lessons-template.md
- adr-template.md
- using-chronicle-template.md

**Key insight:** The skill should be comprehensive enough that after initialization, the project is completely self-contained. We're dogfooding this by using chronicle to document chronicle.

### Development Approach

1. Use chronicle principles to document design decisions
2. Create all templates based on real usage (this repo)
3. Test with multiple project types before release
4. Extract common patterns into skill logic

### Testing Strategy

See `.chronicle/execution/validation-strategy.md` for complete validation approach.

*Note: This project uses chronicle to document itself - it's self-referential by design.*
