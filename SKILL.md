# Chronicle: The Complete Record of Your Project's Journey

## Overview

Chronicle creates a self-contained documentation system that enables:
- **Task Organization** - Never ask "what's next?"
- **Journey Documentation** - Capture why, not just what  
- **AI Context Preservation** - Enable seamless collaboration across sessions

From the chronicle alone, someone - human or AI - should be able to understand your project well enough to continue building it effectively.

## When to Use

Use chronicle for:
- Long-running AI-assisted projects
- Projects with extended breaks between sessions
- Complex builds (software, DIY, presentations, creative work)
- Team handoffs and onboarding
- Learning from past decisions and failures

## Initialization Command

```
"Initialize chronicle"
"Set up chronicle for this project"
```

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Questioning (15-28 minutes)

**Foundation Questions (3-5 min):**
Ask 10 core questions with compressed examples:

1. What is this project? (1 sentence)
2. Why does it exist? What job is it hired to do?
3. Who will use/benefit from it?
4. What does success look like? (concrete outcomes)
5. What should this NOT do? (non-goals)
6. Key constraints? (technical, time, budget)
7. Timeline and urgency?
8. Solo, team, or organization?
9. Similar to anything you've built? (analogies)
10. Riskiest assumption or biggest worry?

**Depth Visualization (2-3 min):**
Show completeness with progress bars:
```
📊 Project Context Completeness
Objectives          ████████░░  80%  Good depth
Constraints         ███░░░░░░░  30%  Needs exploration
Non-goals           ██████████ 100%  Clear

🎯 Recommended deep dives:
1. Constraints (30% - critical gap)
2. Risks (10% - helps prevent issues)
```

User chooses areas for deeper exploration.

**Targeted Deep Dives (10-20 min):**
3-4 questions per selected area from different angles:
- Outcome focus
- User job (Jobs-to-be-Done)
- Trade-offs and boundaries
- Measurable criteria

**Adaptive logic:**
- Software projects: Add technical architecture questions
- Solo projects: Skip team questions
- Deadline projects: Add milestone questions
- No deadline: Focus on quality/learning

**Handling uncertainty:**
- One reframe attempt per question
- If still uncertain → mark as TBD, move on
- Don't overuse 5 Whys technique

**Summary & Validation (2-3 min):**
Show comprehensive summary, wait for user confirmation before creating files.

### Phase 2: Bootstrap Structure

Create directory structure:
```
.chronicle/
├── project-truth.md           # Populated from Q&A
├── active-tasks.md            # Empty template
├── context/
│   ├── visuals/
│   └── decisions/
│       └── index.md
├── journey/
│   ├── session-log.md
│   ├── completed-tasks.md
│   └── lessons.md
└── execution/
    ├── parts-manifest.md
    ├── key-patterns.md
    ├── key-facts.md
    └── validation-strategy.md
```

**Auto-detection for software projects:**
If code files exist (*.cs, *.js, package.json, *.csproj, src/):
- Generate architecture diagrams (using mermaid-diagrams skill if available)
- Rename parts-manifest.md → component-manifest.md
- Rename validation-strategy.md → testing-strategy.md
- Add software-specific terminology

### Phase 3: Write Protocols to CLAUDE.md

Append complete chronicle protocols to CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- CHRONICLE SYSTEM PROTOCOLS                                   -->
<!-- Generated by: chronicle skill v1.0.0                         -->
<!-- Initialized: [DATE]                                          -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Chronicle System

[Complete 200-line protocol - see templates/claude-protocols.md]

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- END CHRONICLE SYSTEM PROTOCOLS                               -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->
```

**Protocol sections:**
- File structure documentation
- Before starting work checklist
- Task management workflow
- Session end protocol
- Decision recording (ADRs)
- Problem logging (lessons.md)
- Context management rules
- Task detection during planning
- Regeneration principle

### Phase 4: Create User Guide

Create `USING-CHRONICLE.md` at project root with:
- What is chronicle (3 purposes)
- Quick reference
- Common workflows
- Understanding the structure
- Tips & best practices
- Troubleshooting
- Phrases cheat sheet

### Phase 5: Completion

```
✓ Chronicle initialized!

Your project now has:
- .chronicle/ directory with complete structure
- CLAUDE.md with operating protocols
- USING-CHRONICLE.md for your reference

To get started:
- Read USING-CHRONICLE.md for usage guide
- Read .chronicle/project-truth.md for project context
- Say "what should I work on?" to begin

The skill is no longer needed - everything is self-contained.
```

## Task Management

Chronicle automatically manages tasks:

**When tasks detected during planning:**
```
User: "I need to implement X, add Y, and create Z"

Chronicle: "I noticed we identified some tasks:
            1. Implement X
            2. Add Y
            3. Create Z
            
            Should I add these to active-tasks.md?"
```

**On task completion:**
```
User: "Mark task complete: implement X"

Chronicle: [Automatically:]
1. Check off in active-tasks.md
2. Move to journey/completed-tasks.md (with date/duration)
3. Add entry to journey/session-log.md
4. Suggest next task
```

## Session End Protocol

```
User: "Update chronicle"

Chronicle: [Walks through:]
1. Summarize session
2. Update session-log.md
3. Move completed tasks
4. Create ADRs if needed
5. Update diagrams if needed
6. Document problems in lessons.md
7. Weekly: Compress into project-truth.md
```

## Context Management

**Always in AI context:**
- .chronicle/project-truth.md
- .chronicle/active-tasks.md
- .chronicle/context/*
- .chronicle/journey/session-log.md
- .chronicle/journey/lessons.md
- .chronicle/execution/*

**Never in AI context:**
- .chronicle/journey/completed-tasks.md (human reference only)
- USING-CHRONICLE.md (user guide only)

## Optional: Update Protocols

```
User: "Update chronicle protocols"

Chronicle: [Updates CLAUDE.md with latest version while preserving customizations]
```

## File Templates

See templates/ directory for:
- claude-protocols.md - Full CLAUDE.md protocol section
- project-truth.md - Populated from Q&A
- active-tasks.md - Task management template
- session-log.md - Session chronicle template
- lessons.md - Problems/learnings template
- using-chronicle.md - User guide
- adr-template.md - Decision record format

## Key Principles

**Self-contained:** After initialization, skill is not needed. Everything operates from CLAUDE.md.

**Regenerative:** From chronicle alone, work should be recreatable by anyone (human or AI).

**Comprehensive:** Captures not just what was built, but why decisions were made and what failed.

**Universal:** Works for software, DIY, presentations, creative projects - any long-running work.

**Transparent:** All files are markdown, directly editable, no magic.

## Philosophy

> "Code is what the computer executes. Documentation is what the team executes. In AI-assisted development, documentation becomes the primary artifact."

Chronicle treats the journey of understanding as more valuable than the artifact. Code can be regenerated; understanding cannot.
