## Format Guidelines

Keep sessions minimal and narrative-focused:
- ~100-200 tokens per session
- High-level summary, not implementation details (git commits cover that)
- Link to ADRs/lessons rather than duplicating content
- Focus on "what happened" for team context

Sessions auto-archive after 14 days (checked weekly on Mondays).
