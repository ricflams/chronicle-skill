# Project Principles

Enduring beliefs that guide decision-making on this project.

---

## [Principle Name]

[Clear statement of the principle. 2-3 sentences explaining the what and why.]

**Tradeoff:** [What we accept by following this principle]

---

## Examples

### We prefer boring technology

Choose proven, well-understood tools over exciting new ones. Boring means reliable, documented, and hire-able.

**Tradeoff:** Missing out on cutting-edge features and performance optimizations.

### Composition over inheritance

Build with small, focused components rather than complex class hierarchies. Easier to test, easier to change.

**Tradeoff:** More glue code to write and maintain.

## Guidelines

- Keep principles sparse (20-25 max before consolidation)
- Always articulate the tradeoff
- Archive outdated principles with ~~strikethrough~~ and note: "Superseded by: [new principle]"
- Principles emerge from patterns, not single decisions
